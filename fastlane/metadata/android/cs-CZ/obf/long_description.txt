***Contribute to Cosmetic Transparency***

- Open Beauty Facts is a cosmetic products database made by everyone, for everyone.
- You can use it to make better cosmetic choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.
- Open Beauty Facts is a non-profit project developed by thousands of volunteers from around the world. We have lots of exciting projects you can contribute to in many different ways. 
- You can start contributing today by adding a product from your cosmetic cupboard. 

*** Get the Facts ***

- Cosmetics additives, F.I.L. codes, CI-numbers, INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients), ingredient list, allergens, packaging codes... 
- Open Beauty Facts helps you to make sense of the fine print on products labels.
- You don't need to be a chemist and learn latin anymore to decypher an ingredient list :-)
- You can scan: aftershaves, body lotions, creams, deodorant, eyeliner, foundation, fragrance, lipstick, makeup, mask, perfume, shampoo, soap, shower gel, nail polish and much more…
- We think it can be useful for people with skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, eczema… to make better cosmetic choices.

*** Works well in any condition ***
- You can add new products, even if you don't have an Internet connection right now.
