*** Get the Facts ***

- Cosmetics additives, F.I.L. codes, CI-numbers, INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients), ingredient list, allergens, packaging codes... 
- Open Beauty Facts helps you to make sense of the fine print on products labels.
- You don't need to be a chemist and learn latin anymore to decypher an ingredient list :-)
- You can scan: aftershaves, body lotions, creams, deodorant, eyeliner, foundation, fragrance, lipstick, makeup, mask, perfume, shampoo, soap, shower gel, nail polish and much more…
- We think it can be useful for people with skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, eczema… to make better cosmetic choices.
