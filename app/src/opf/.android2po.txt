# This is an example configuration file for android2po, explaining the
# various options in more detail.
#
# Remove the comments for those options that you want to use.
#
# You probably want to copy this file as ".android2po" into the directory
# containing your "AndroidManifest.xml" file, so it'll be picked up
# automatically.


# If you don't like the default location, you can specify where the .po files
# should be stored. This path is relative to the path of this configuration
# file.
#--gettext locale/


# By default, android2po will always process strings.xml and arrays.xml files,
# as well as all files which are found to contain string resources. However,
# you may often find it necessary to restrict the files used. This option
# allows to explicitly define the groups being processed.
--groups strings arrays


# Specify a custom gettext domain. A gettext domain is like a namespace for
# your application, in case mutliple independent gettext enabled domains need
# to work together. As far is it concerns us here, this only affects the
# location and filename of the .po files inside the --gettext directory.
#
# You do not need to specify a domain. See the --layout option for more
# information.
#--domain android

# Determines how the .po files should be stored inside the --gettext directory.
# If not specified, .po files will be stored in
#    - {gettext}/{locale}.po - if no domain was given
#    - {gettext}/{domain}-{locale}.po - if a domain was given
# If you use the magic keyword "gnu", the standard gnu layout will
# automatically be used:
#    {gettext}/{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/{domain}.po
# You may also customize the path completely using a Python format string with
# the mandatory variables %(locale)s and %(domain)s. Optionally, you may also
# include %(group)s. This is really only useful if you want the different
# Android XML resource files (strings.xml, arrays.xml) to end up in different
# gettext catalogs (see the XXX option [needs to be implemented]).
#--layout gnu
#--layout %(locale)/%(domain).po
#--layout %(locale)/%(domain)/%(group).po


# Customize the name of the .pot template file (basically a .po file without
# any translations). Similar to --layout, it may contain %(domain)s and
# %(group)s placeholders.
#--template template.pot
#--template %(domain)s-template.pot

# If you don't need the .pot template file, you can tell a2po not to generate
# it at all.
#--no-template


# You can specify multiple message ids that should be ignored. Those will not
# be included when generating the .po file. As you can see, you may use regular
# expressions if you surround the expression using forward slashes.
#
# As an alternative, you can also add the attribute translatable="false" to the
# string that you want to have ignored.
#--ignore app_name color_names
#--ignore /^pref/
#--ignore /^error_level_[0-9]*$/

# This will cause messages that are marked as "fuzzy" in .po files to be
# ignored on import.
#--ignore-fuzzy


# This will ignore all strings for a language if it's .po file does not have
# the given minimum percentage of translated strings. This is useful if you
# don't want to ship your app with an incomplete translation, resulting in a
# mix of localized and English texts. Set this to 1 if you want to include
# only a complete translation.
#
# If you export into multiple .po files per language, they will be counted
# as a collective for the purposes of this option.
#
# If --ignore-fuzzy is also set, then fuzzy strings will not be counted towards
# to total.
#--require-min-complete 0.9
