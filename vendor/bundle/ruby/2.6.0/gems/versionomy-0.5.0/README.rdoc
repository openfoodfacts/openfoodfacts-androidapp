== Versionomy

Versionomy is a generalized version number library.
It provides tools to represent, manipulate, parse, and compare version
numbers in the wide variety of versioning schemes in use.

This document summarizes the features of Versionomy with a quick synopsis
and feature list. For more detailed usage information and examples, see
{Versionomy.rdoc}[link:Versionomy\_rdoc.html].

=== Some examples

 require 'versionomy'

 # Create version numbers that understand their own semantics
 v1 = Versionomy.create(:major => 1, :minor => 3, :tiny => 2)
 v1.major                                 # => 1
 v1.minor                                 # => 3
 v1.tiny                                  # => 2
 v1.release_type                          # => :final
 v1.patchlevel                            # => 0

 # Parse version numbers, including common prerelease syntax
 v2 = Versionomy.parse('1.4a3')
 v2.major                                 # => 1
 v2.minor                                 # => 4
 v2.tiny                                  # => 0
 v2.release_type                          # => :alpha
 v2.alpha_version                         # => 3
 v2 > v1                                  # => true
 v2.to_s                                  # => '1.4a3'

 # Version numbers are semantically self-adjusting.
 v3 = Versionomy.parse('1.4.0b2')
 v3.major                                 # => 1
 v3.minor                                 # => 4
 v3.tiny                                  # => 0
 v3.release_type                          # => :beta
 v3.alpha_version                         # raises NoMethodError
 v3.beta_version                          # => 2
 v3 > v2                                  # => true
 v3.to_s                                  # => '1.4.0b2'

 # You can bump any field
 v4 = Versionomy.parse('1.4.0b2').bump(:beta_version)
 v4.to_s                                  # => '1.4.0b3'
 v5 = v4.bump(:tiny)
 v5.to_s                                  # => '1.4.1'

 # Bumping the release type works as you would expect
 v6 = Versionomy.parse('1.4.0b2').bump(:release_type)
 v6.release_type                          # => :release_candidate
 v6.to_s                                  # => '1.4.0rc1'
 v7 = v6.bump(:release_type)
 v7.release_type                          # => :final
 v7.to_s                                  # => '1.4.0'

 # If a version has trailing zeros, it remembers how many fields to
 # unparse; however, you can also change this.
 v8 = Versionomy.parse('1.4.0b2').bump(:major)
 v8.to_s                                  # => '2.0.0'
 v8.unparse(:optional_fields => [:tiny])  # => '2.0'
 v8.unparse(:required_fields => [:tiny2]) # => '2.0.0.0'

 # Comparisons are semantic, so will behave as expected even if the
 # formatting is set up differently.
 v9 = Versionomy.parse('2.0.0.0')
 v9.to_s                                  # => '2.0.0.0'
 v9 == Versionomy.parse('2')              # => true

 # Patchlevels are supported when the release type is :final
 v10 = Versionomy.parse('2.0.0').bump(:patchlevel)
 v10.patchlevel                           # => 1
 v10.to_s                                 # => '2.0.0-1'
 v11 = Versionomy.parse('2.0p1')
 v11.patchlevel                           # => 1
 v11.to_s                                 # => '2.0p1'
 v11 == v10                               # => true

 # You can create your own format from scratch or by modifying an
 # existing format
 microsoft_format = Versionomy.default_format.modified_copy do
   field(:minor) do
     recognize_number(:default_value_optional => true,
                      :delimiter_regexp => '\s?sp',
                      :default_delimiter => ' SP')
   end
 end
 v12 = microsoft_format.parse('2008 SP2')
 v12.major                                # => 2008
 v12.minor                                # => 2
 v12.tiny                                 # => 0
 v12.to_s                                 # => '2008 SP2'
 v12 == Versionomy.parse('2008.2')        # => true

=== Feature list

Versionomy's default versioning scheme handles four primary fields (labeled
+major+, +minor+, +tiny+, and +tiny2+). It also supports prerelease versions
such as preview, development, alpha, beta, and release candidate. Finally,
it supports patchlevel numbers for released versions.

Versionomy can compare any two version numbers with compatible structure,
and "bump" versions at any level. It supports parsing and unparsing in most
commonly-used formats, and allows you to extend the parsing to include
custom formats.

Finally, Versionomy also lets you to create alternate versioning "schemas".
You can define any number of version number fields, and provide your own
semantics for comparing, parsing, and modifying version numbers. You can
provide conversions from one schema to another. As an example, Versionomy
provides a schema and formatter/parser matching Gem::Version.

=== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or later, JRuby 1.5 or later, or Rubinius 1.0 or later.
* blockenspiel 0.5.0 or later.

=== Installation

 gem install versionomy

=== Known issues and limitations

* Test coverage is still a little skimpy. It is focused on the "standard"
  version number format and schema, but doesn't fully exercise all the
  capabilities of custom formats.
