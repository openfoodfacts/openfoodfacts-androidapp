## What is Open Food Facts?

### A food products database

Open Food Facts is a database of food products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts… which allow us to compute scores like Nutri-Score, NOVA groups and Eco-Score.

### Made by everyone

Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
25000+ contributors like you have added 1,7M+ products from 150 countries using our Android or iPhone apps to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

### For everyone

Data about food is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data and can be reused by anyone.

## User flows

For historic reasons, it's openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood in the code and on F-Droid.|

## Running a Fastlane lane
The project uses Fastlane to automate release and screenshots generation.
* First time you checkout, run `bundle install` at the root of the project
* Then launch lanes using `bundle exec fastlane release` (for example the release lane)
* We're moving Fastlane related things to https://github.com/openfoodfacts/fastlane-descriptions

### Who do I talk to?
