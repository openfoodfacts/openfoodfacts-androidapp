## What is Open Food Facts?

### A food products database

Open Food Facts is a database of food products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts… which allow us to compute scores like Nutri-Score, NOVA groups and Eco-Score.

### Made by everyone

Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
25000+ contributors like you have added 1,7M+ products from 150 countries using our Android or iPhone apps to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

### For everyone

Data about food is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data and can be reused by anyone.

## Ongoing documentation of user flows
